### AWS CLI, creating a budget and billing alarm

Homework included creating an admin user and AWS credentials as well as installing AWS CLI on Gitpod. 

The budget was created through AWS CLI on Gitpod based on the budget and budget notifications JSON-files on the AWS/JSON-folder. There is also a JSON file for the billing alarm. It required first a new SNS topic for which the subscription had to be confirmed via email. After that the actual Cloudwatch alarm wcould be created through AWS CLI.


## Homework challenges

### Architectual diagram of the CI/CD pipeline

As an additional challenged I attempted to create an architectual diagram of the CI/CD pipeline according to my current understanding. I will be adding the missing part of the bootcamp progresses.
