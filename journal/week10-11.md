# Week 10-11 — CloudFormation
## Live-Stream Cloudformation (CFN) Basics

You can organize your CFN templates in different logical entities. You could for example have your networking infrastructure in one CFN template and application in another. It is often easier to make smaller sections and then later combine them if you have to. Otherwise, it’s difficult to know what’s going on if they fail. You also loose some flexibility if you combine the stacks together. 

You have to consider how your different stacks are going to be connected. For example, our cluster is probably going to reference the networking stack. The database might be orphaned or connected to networking.

## Implement CFN Networking Layer

In terms of networking, going through the core components is very important. It would be possibly to use the default VPC for this project, but the decision was made to create a new VPC using CFN.

First a networking folder was created in the CFN folder. A ``template.yaml`` was created in the folder. Also a bin script was added for deploying the networking stack. Added also Readme.md that has instructions to create an S3 bucket for CFN artifacts. This bucket was created directly in the AWS console instead of CFN.

## Implement CFN Networking Layer (Diagram)

The diagram shows the three public subnets that are used as well as three private subnets that are currently not used but were created for possible future use. The Fargate cluster spans accross the three public subnets:
