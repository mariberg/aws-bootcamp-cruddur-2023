# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Required homework

### Honeycomb

During this week live lesson we learned about Honeycam and instrumented our backend Flask -applicaiton to use OTEL (Open Telemetry) with Honeycomb.io as the provider. We started by creating a new environment called 'bootcamp' and copying the API key from Honeycomb.io and setting that as an envinroment variable on Gitpod. We added OTEL settings in docker-compose -file. We did this for the backend now, but same could be later added for frontend -application as well. We followed instructions on Honeycomb.io to complete the installation, which required adding files to requirements.txt and App.py -files. 

Our cloud environment is now sending standardise messages to Honeycomb.io and Honeycomb stores them in the database and gives an UI to look at them. 

We ran queries to explorer traces within Honeycomb.io.
